### JS Essentials for React

Here I have covered the following topics:

1. Destructuring an Array
2. Rest, Spread Operators
3. Arrow Functions
4. Template Literals
5. Ternary Operators
6. Short Circuiting
7. Nullish Coalescing operator
8. Array Map Method
9. Array Filter Method
10. Array Reduce Method
11. Array Sort Method
12. Immutable Arrays
13. Understanding promises
14. Async and Await functions

Note: I've used an extension called "Quokka" which helps to display JavaScript outputs in real time without the hassle of checking the console everytime. Hence, you will not find many console.log statements. My purpose was to only understand the working of essentials.

Also, some part of code has been commented out to avoid errors as one lesson might contradict the variable values of other.
