### Profile Card Challenge 1

Approach I've used :

- Components
- Props for data and CSS

Approaches I tried but wasn't successful (for now):

Note : This part is commented out in the code

- Was able to use map function to dynamically pick the content for "skill tags" using an array. This helped to reduce the code length, redundancy and kept it all clean.

- Failed to pass color for the skill-tag from another array
